Simple Cryptocurrency Transaction Tracking:

The Challenge: Build an API endpoint that accepts a cryptocurrency address (Ethereum, for example). It should retrieve the last 5 transactions for that address from a blockchain explorer API (e.g., Etherscan) and store them in MongoDB. Allow users to query for transactions by address and date range.
Focus: Exposes knowledge of external APIs, data parsing, and efficient database storage.
